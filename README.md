#PROBLEM FORMULATION#

1/ Why are the customers churning?

2/Can we determine which customers will leave so that we have 
an intensive Marketing campaign to prevent the churn?

#STEPS INVOLVED#

1/Data cleaning, EDA (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

2/Data Balancing (Upsampling, Downsampling, SMOTE)

3/Running different ML algorithms with different hyperparameters using MLflow

#ORDER OF EXECUTION OF FILES

First run dataAnalysis.py to have some insights about your data.
Second run whichever file prefixed by 'train_' you'd like.
As you might expect, the algorithm that's trained is indicated in
the file's name after 'train_'.
For example, 'train_logistic_regression.py', uses the logistic 
regression algorithm.
